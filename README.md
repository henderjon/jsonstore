An all-too-simple disc based key/value store. It reads and write JSON to flat
files. There is no caching or memory gymnastics. Data to JSON to disc and vice
versa.

## FAQ

### Why another json based key value thingy?

Because I needed one and every other one is more than I needed.

### My aunt Flo wrote one, why should I use yours?

You probably shouldn't. Hers is most likely better.

### You're missing feature "X".

I know.
